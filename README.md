# techdegree-project-3
 Third techdegree project

    This is the longest project I have worked on thus far, and the most difficult part wasn't necessarily the concepts or actions required by the project, but rather the tedium of having to do all of it.  That's not to say that the actual coding itself didn't present challenges, in fact I spent the better part of two days struggling with code that I had made much more complicated than it needed to be.  When I finaly found a way around it, it took me about 15 minutes to write what I couldn't accomplish in severeal hours.
    
    I consider both of these things to be positive points: they are obstacles that I have overcome, rather than obstacles that prevented me from progressing.  That is the mindset that kept me motivated to continue, even while I struggeled.
